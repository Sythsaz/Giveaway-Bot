# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the Giveaway Bot.

## 🚀 Planned Features

### Data Management & Privacy

- [ ] **GDPR Data Deletion Command**: Add a command (e.g., `!giveaway data delete <user>`) to automate the removal of
      user data from local dump files and active state to simplify GDPR compliance.

## 💡 Potential Improvements

- [ ] **Global Variable Auto-Import**: Fully automate the restoration of Streamer.bot global variables from
      `giveaway_config.json` on startup (currently partially manual for new installs).
- [ ] **Localization Support**: Allow configuration of response messages for different languages.
